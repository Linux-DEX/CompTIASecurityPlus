** Smishing
A social engineering attack that uses fake mobile text messages to trick people into downloading malware, sharing sensitive infromation, or sending money to cybercriminals.

** Vishing
Short for "voice phishing" which involves defrauding people over the phone, enticing them to divulge sensitive information.

** Spam
Unsolicited and unwanted junk email sent out in bulk to a wholesale recipient list.

** Spam over instant messaging(SPIM)
Spam messages symptomatic of widely-used free instant messaging apps like Messenger, Whatsapp, Viber, Telegram, Skype and WeChat.

** spear phishing
A type of phishing campaign that targets a specific person or group and often will include information known to be of interst to the target, such as current event or financial documents.

** Dumpster surfing
A cyberattack where the attacker get their hand on sensitive documents or data you carelessly threw into the trash bin.

** Shoulder surfing
Attacks such as shoulder surfing involve observing you use your mobile phone, laptop or credit card in order to steal you sensitive personal information.

** Pharming
Online fraud that involves the use of malicious code to direct victims to spoofed websites in an attempt to steal their credentials and data.

** Tailgating
where an attacker follows an unaware user to gain access to an area without authorization.

** Eliciting information
A structured method of communication used to extract predetermined information from people without making them aware that they are a collection target.

** Whaling
A highly targeted phishing attack - aimed at senior executives - masquerading as a legitimate email.

** Prepending
When an attacker prepends, or attaches, a trushworthy value like "RE:" or "MAILSAFE:PASSED" to a message in order to make the message appear more trustworthy.

** Identity fraud
The attacker's use of online platforms to steal indentities and commit online fraud.

** Invoice scams
Can come from a fake or a hijacked vendor account.

** Credential harvesting
It is also known as password harvesting or username harvesting, is a form of cyberattack that involves the theft of personal or financial data such as username and passwords, typically carried out through phishing, malicious website, email scams, or malware but not always.

** Reconnaissance
the infromation-gathering stage of ethical hacking where you collect data about the target system.

** Hoax
A computer virus hoax is a message warning the recipients of a non-existent computer virus threat.

** Impresonation
Cybercrime where a criminal pretends to be a known person or organization to steal confidential data or money. 

** Watering hole attacks
A form of cyberattack that targets groups of users by infecting websites that they commonly visit.

** Typosquatting
A form of cybersquatting (sitting on sites under someone else's brand or copyright) that targets internet users who incorrectly type a website address into their web browser.

** Pretexting
Pretexting is use of a fabricated story, or pretext, to gain a victim's trust and trick or manipulate them into sharing sensitive information, downloading malware, sending money to criminals, or otherwise harming themselves or the organization they work for.

** Influence Campaignss
A powerful strategy if approached with authenticity and strategic thinking.

*** Hybrid warfare
Traditional warfare techniques are combined with hacking and the previously mentioned influence campaigns.

*** Social media
Part of more extensive campaigns which use other techniques such as espionage and hacking.

** Principles (Reasons for effectiveness)
- Authority
- Intimidation
- Consensus
- Familiarity
- Trust
- Urgency+Scarcity
  
* 1.2 Malware
Malware (malicious software) is a file or code, typically delivered over a network, that infects, explores steals or conducts virtually any behavios an attacker wants.

** Ransomware
ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts files or blocks access to a computer system. Cybercriminals demand ransom money in exchange for releasing the data.
*example*: cryptorbit

** Trojans
A type of malware that downloads onto a computer disguised as a legitimate program.
*example*: trojan horse.

** Worms
A type of malware or malicious software that can replicate repidly and spread across devices within a network.
*example*: raspberry robin malware

** Command and control
 A type of cyberattack that allows attackers to remotely control and manipulate compromised systems. It is also known as C2 attack.

** Fileless virus
Code that works directly within a computer's memory instead of the hard drive. It uses legitimate programs to compromise you computer instead of malicious files.

** Bots
A type of software application or script that performs automated tasks on command.

** Cryptomalware
Malware that encrypts data on the victim's device and demands a ransom to restore it.

** Logic bombs
A piece of often-malicious code that is intentionly inserted into software. It remains dormant until specific conditions are met. When triggered, a logic bomb executes a destructive action, such as
- deleting files
- disrupting critical system

** Spyware
Malicious software that enters a user's computer, gathers data from the device and user, and sends it to third parties without their consent.

** Keyloggers
Tools that record what a person types on a device.

** Remote access trojan (RAT)
Malware designed to allow an attacker to remotely control an infected computer.
*example:* subseven

** Rootkit
A rootkit attack occurs when a piece of malicious software infiltrates a computer, enabling an attacker to gain access and control of the machine and steal data from it.

** Backdoor
A backdoor is a method of bypassing an organization's security systems. Backdoors are also known as *trap doors*. They are built into software by the original programmer.


** Potentially unwanted programs (PUPs)
A program that may be unwanted, despite the possibility that users consented to download it.

* 1.3 Password Attacks
OS and application run the hash function and store the password in hash value.

input + hash Function = hash value

** Spraying
A type of brute force attack where a malicious actor attempts the same password on many accounts before moving on to another one and repeating the process.

** Dictionary
A method of breaking into a password-protected computer, network or other IT resource by systematically entering every word in a dictionary as a password.

** Brute force (offline and online)
A trial-and-error method used by application programs to decode login information and encryption keys to use them to gain unauthorized access to system.

** Rainbow table
A password cracking method that uses a special table (a *rainbow table*) to crack the password hashes in a database.

** Plaintext/unencrypted
Involves accessing a password in its original, unencrypted form. This can occur if the password is stored in clear text in a file or database, or if it is transmitted over the network without being encrypted.

* 1.4 Physical Attacks
An attacker gains physical access to a physical asset in the infrastructure system in order to damage it, disable it steal it, or use it in an undesirable way.

** Malicious Universal Serial Bus (USB) cable
Method that can be used to steal data, take control of a device, or introduce a virus. The cable looks normal, but has additional electronics inside. It can tell your operatin system that it is a human interface device (HID)
*** A malicious USB calbe can:
- Be controlled remotely by a hacker
- Monitor the victim machine for inactivity
- Silently compromise the victim's machine without their knowledge
- Allow hackers access to your device.

** Malicious flash drive
Method where a malicious flash drive or a malicious USB cable is inserted into a victim's computer. This attack preys on victim's ignorance and trust in devices.

** Skimming
As the word *skim* means *to read quickly*, criminals use various devices, known as skimmers, to steal data without the victim even realising it.

*** Card Cloning
Most credit card cloning fraud is done through the use of skimmers. Skimmers read credit card infromation such as numbers, PINs, CVV data through the magnetic stripe, and can be attached to hardware such as point of sale (POS) terminal.

* 1.5 Adversarial Artifical Intelligence
Adversarial AI is the use of algorithm and mathematical approaches to manipulate, deny, deceive, or degrade AI systems. Adversarial attacks can be used to:
- Fool intrusion detection system.
- Cause machine learning models to make incorrect predictions
- manipulate the machine learning process.

* 1.6 Supply Chain Attacks
When someone uses an outside provider or partner that has access to your data and systems to infiltrate your digital infrastructure.
